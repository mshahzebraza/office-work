# Tasks/Issues

- **Add PO item:**
  - After displaying custom options in the dropdown, writing-in-input doesn't work anymore
  - Something is not right with the AutoComplete position, maybe due to no-helper-text...
  - conversion of addPOitem forms to MUI form elements ongoing...
  - Need to add some dropdown features to the forms.
  - MUI form elements are not yet fully implemented.
