# Tasks

- There should be breadcrumbs at the top of each page.
- create the Primary Inventory Page
  - will contain the Special Purchase parts + Mfg parts
- define a strict pattern of ID for standard modules like screw
  - For instance, **`id:`**`[headType] M {head}x{length}`
  - parts filtered as `otherParts`, (other than mfg, std etc.) are not being used anywhere. Try to show these items somewhere.
  - create a uniform styles file to show summary data. Right now, projectSummary Modal shows very different styles than poSummary Modal.
  - Right now, Update forms can be submitted without making any change. This causes an unnecessary update-request. Make use of **isDirty** property of formik to solve the issue.
  - Instead of Spec,Std & Mfg, use Spec-Std, Std & Mfg. Follow the same convention everywhere. Right now there is inconsistency of terms among components.
  - Array Entries are shown without any header. This makes it difficult to know at what position does a specific information lie. (Tables should have a header row for poList, txnLis, mwoList etc.)
  - Try to create an auto-summary Generator
    - This must be able to map through key-values and arrays as well.
- ~~Create a function to identify if `_id` is present in the poSpecs. If it is present then disable the editing of `_id`.~~
- Understand the working of advanced field props and custom fields of FORMIK
- Upon closing a PO, the change is registered in PO backend but not in transaction backend.
- **_Create backend connection for the remaining data structure as well._**
  - Create Models & Schemas for all
  - **Create API Handling**
  - Create Controllers for APIs
  - Include API request in existing state management functions (...Apollo)
  - Create new API request functions to fetch data slice on page load
- Think about skipping the \_id for po-specifications.
- Ensure that \_v (version) is not being returned in PO & MWO Api. Otherwise the \_v would also be saved in the state and on the next update call, the old version would replace the new one.
  - It is noted that updatePO doesn't change the \_v as it uses overwrite to update PO. And version is changed only when **update** is used.
  - Upon changing the fields or nested documents, **version** is updated bcz `update` method is used to change the document. If it is replaced completely then the version shown is false.
- ~~On App Load, PO Apollo fetches MWO List and vice versa. This behavior can be seen clearly if loadPOs/loadMWOs is commented which loads the other one perfectly. Maybe we should create a loadAllData funciton that fetches data for all the State Slices.~~
- **Project Forms are not working**.
  - Only capital nomenclature is categorized into standard parts. "Bearing" shows up in misc section instead of bearing section.
  - No Nomenclature is shown for standard parts. (a "------" is shown instead)
  - "Add Parts" button works the same way for standard and special parts as well.
    - The drop down for part-type must be limited in only the options of the relevant category.
    - Standard parts form should enforce "standard" as a category.
    - Deleting an assembly must delete parts related to it as well.
    - parts don't show their parent assembly directly in the entry bar. (There's enough space for that as well)
    - summary component is not yet made for project parts.
    - reset target button is not working yet
