# Tasks/Issues

- **Breadcrumbs:** create at the top of each page.
- **Primary Inventory Page** create the
  - will contain the Special Purchase parts + Mfg parts
- define a strict pattern of ID for standard modules like screw
  - For instance, **`id:`**`[headType] M {head}x{length}`
  - parts filtered as `otherParts`, (other than mfg, std etc.) are not being used anywhere. Try to show these items somewhere.
- **Consistent Summary Styles:** for every kind of summary data. Right now, projectSummary Modal shows very different styles than poSummary Modal.
- **Auto-Summary Generator**: to map through key-values and arrays as well.
- **Improve Form Updates:** Make forms unable to submit without data change. (use of **isDirty** property of formik)
- **Consistent Nomenclature:** Instead of Spec,Std & Mfg, use Spec-Std, Std & Mfg. Follow the same convention everywhere.
- **Entries Header:** (Tables/Row Entries should have a header row for poList, txnLis, mwoList etc.)
- **Stop version overwrite:** In the update functions, the document version (from mongo) is often overwritten by the previous copy (thus remains unchanged).
- **Projects Component**
  - Only capital nomenclature is categorized into standard parts. "Bearing" shows up in misc section instead of bearing section.
  - No Nomenclature is shown for standard parts. (a "------" is shown instead)
  - "Add Parts" button works the same way for standard and special parts as well.
  - Deleting an assembly must delete parts related to it as well.
  - parts don't show their parent assembly directly in the entry bar. (There's enough space for that as well)
  - summary component is not yet made for project parts.
  - "Reset Target" button is not working yet
- **Part-Type Filtering in Forms**.
  - The drop down for part-type must be limited in only the options of the relevant category.
  - Standard parts Form should enforce "standard" as a category.
- **Create A Login Page**.
- **Create Transaction Page**.
  - Forms
  - API Functions
