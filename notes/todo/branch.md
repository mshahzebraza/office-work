# Troubleshooting

## Master/Detail Pattern - MWO & PO

- 1st option is to create a detail view for each master view (MWO as well)
- 2nd option is to remove the detail view and render the details in a separate component which can slide between the rows of each entry
  - Compare the component and dependency imports in master & detail page of PO
  - Compare the use of state for both master & detail page of PO
