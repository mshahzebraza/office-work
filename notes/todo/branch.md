# Troubleshooting

### Bonus

  - Still do not have some fields
  - error on deleting - sometimes
- Projects Page
  - Summary button to show summary of project is not working
  - view-logic of projects is not working
  - restructuring of apollo & controller logic to make the project consistent with projectModel is needed.
  - Create a tree of assemblies using the parent-child linkage
- centralization of MWO_Summary? and of MWO_entry
- module state-manipulation functions are combined for po & mwo
  - segregate the po-module and mwo-module into separate functions to avoid separating the logic using if-else on params
  - where do we keep the item-spec function
- Inv is the combo of Projects and Transactions.
  - Correct the Project Adding Logic (FE & BE)
  - What happens to txns when the original PO/MWO is deleted.
